# javasidescroller-prototype

A small side scroller type game prototype I made a couple of years ago. The keys are WASD. At the ledges of blocks, press W to go up. There are random maps, character sprites, and gravity. The small turtle is the beginnings of an enemy.

The character is from Secret of Mana, and the turtle is from the Super Mario series.
